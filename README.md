# Todo Application

## This is your basic todo application.
## This is supposed to demonstrate my current React / Redux capabilities, and showcase my first GoLang api.

## Running the application:
### Navigate to project folder in a terminal and run:
```
yarn && yarn start
```

### If you do not have `yarn` installed, please run:
```
npm install -g yarn
```
### OR
### run:
```
npm install && npm run start
```
